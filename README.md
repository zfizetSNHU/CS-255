Repository for System Analysis and Design Course

Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

The DriverPass project was a project that was started between my consulting company and representatives from our client, DriverPass. Liam is the owner of DriverPass and was interviewed by Sam and Jennifer from our company to learn about what Liam was hoping to achieve with his system.
The system that Liam and DriverPass wanted us to design for him had 2 different "main" components. The first component of this system was an online platform where users could book reservations for driving training to better prepare people for driving tests at the DMV. The second aspect of this system was that of an online learning platform where users could take online classes and practice tests to prepare them for the actual tests they would take at the DMV.

What did you do particularly well?

I felt that the parts that I did the best were all of the different diagrams that I created for this project. It was interesting to learn about each different diagram and what kind of information each one conveys to the reader.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I would personally revise the business requirement document as some of my requirements were incorrect. There were a few requirements that I mixed up when determining which were functional and which were non-functional requirements. I also think that I could have combined
some of the requirements so that the document was much more concise and easier to read.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

The main way that I interpreted the user's needs when creating this system design by constantly referring to the interview transcript that was provided. Any time I had a question about something I needed to include, or even exclude, I referred to the interview document.
When I was working on this project, I always had that document opened up so that I could easily re-read any important details. It is important to consider the user's needs when designing a system for them because when you are designing the system, you need to ensure that
the system you are creating is accomplishing the goals that they wish to accomplish by having this system created for them. In this case, the client wanted the system to have a reservation/booking system created. If we excluded that aspect, or even if we excluded the
testing/online class aspect, we wouldn't be meeting the needs of the user. Additionally, considering the needs of the user will help you determine what requirements the system has to have. For example, the client wanted the system to be wanted to be cloud-based and they didn't
want to worry about security or backups. These details provide for us some of the requirements of the system.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

When I design software, I first like to figure out everything that HAS to be included in the software. The details are very important, so I like to ensure that I have all of the information that I need before I sit down and start writing code. Having this information provides
a great starting point for my code, as if I don't have this information, I can't really determine what I should be working on. When designing a system in the future, I will reference the business requirements document, as I felt that outline was a massive help when figuring out
what information I needed to be looking for when I was gathering my data.
